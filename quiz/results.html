				<span id="intro1" style="display:none">
					Welcome, Dear Visitor. Come closer into the candle light; let me view you clearly.

					Ah, I see. It is good you came to me, indeed. Love has not been kind to you, has it?

					So often we convince ourselves we're content with the ones we're with or even with ourselves, simply because we cannot see past where we are now. “Now.” What a despicable word, don't you think? Why limit your search for love to a partner whose pulse beats in the same years yours does?

					Dear Visitor, the present is good enough for drudges, but not one such as you. I shudder to think of the heart that lets itself be trapped in a cage of time!

					All that matters in a soul mate is the soul, and I know many such souls waiting for a human host such as you.

					Now, let's find your match.
				</span>
				<span id="intro2" style="display:none">
					Welcome, dear Visitor. I was wondering when you would come to me.

					You will have realized by now that you are not the kind who should be limited to one era, in love and in all things. Your aura shines so bright it shimmers beyond the present and casts shadows on the past.

					There are some ghosts who have seen it, and are quite eager to meet you. Shall we find you a match?
				</span>
				<span id="middle">
					Hmmm.. you are a tricky one, my dear. I see no mere Casper or Headless Horseman will do for you.

					Ah, here comes a soul that resonates with your own...
				</span>
				<span id="zhengiText" style="display:none">
					For you, there is none other than "The Terror of the South China Seas," the pirate lord, Zheng Shi.

					You're done with meaningless flirtations and have no time for divas. You deserve someone who can make a serious commitment, and who better for a no-nonsense relationship than a woman known for ...correcting.. adultery among her crew with beheadings?

					Zheng Shi will be in this romance for the long haul. Not even the Qing emperor's armada can keep her from something -- or someone -- she's set her sights on.

					With a sense of adventure as boundless as your own, Zheng Shi will let you unleash your wild, side, but it won't all be smooth sailing. You're both strong personalities, with tempers that run hot. The relationship will be rough and stormy as the high seas, but it'll be worth the spoils.

					Zheng Shi will plunder your heart and bury it so deep no one can ever find it.
				</span>
				<span id="appleseedText" style="display:none">
					You want someone down to earth, but think a little mystery keeps things romantic.

					For you, the perfect match is Johnny Appleseed. A famous American folk hero, Johnny's own history is as much legend as fact.

					Johnny is affectionate, but a traveler at heart; he knows how to nurture a budding relationship without smothering it. He'll share your love of nature, and let you live your own life without demands. As generous in love as he is with his apples, Johnny won't ask questions if you, too, wander and spread some seeds. In the end, you'll both return and find you fall into place together, easy as pie.
				</span>
				<span id="caesarText" style="display:none">
					A dangerous bad-boy is just your type, and nothing quite says 'rebel' like crossing the Rubicon and starting a civil war. Give him a chance and Julius Caesar will conquer your heart like he conquered Gaul.

					You're both ambitious, dynamic, and used to getting what you want. Neither of you can stay at home watching a movie on Friday night: you want to be out living, conquering, and changing the face of nations.

					Your romance is as fated as the Ides of March. Julius Caesar believes this could be love ... et tu?
				</span>
				<span id="sacagaweaText" style="display:none">
					You're a classic romantic, and your ideal date is a long walk on the beach at sunset. Sacagawea knows all about long walks ...on the beach, through uncharted forests, over the Rocky Mountains... pretty much everywhere.

					This is one lady who won't give up if things get hard. Brave and undaunted by hardship, Sacagawea will guide this relationship through rough terrain and thorny issues, and take your love life to unknown frontiers. She really would walk a thousand miles to see you; after all, she's walked thousands of miles before.

					She is fluent in Shoshone, French, Hidatsa, and, most importantly, the language of the heart. Set out on a life together with a love that will redraw the map. It'll be an expedition you won't regret.
				</span>
				<span id="tutText" style="display:none">
					At your core, you’re a traditionalist. What matters most to you are family and religion, and you couldn't be happy with anyone who doesn’t feel the same. Turns out, you’ve got a lot in common with Tutankhamun, the child-king who restored the old gods, and loved his sister more than any other lady. (Of course, that love pales in comparison to what you two could have!)
 
					You may have principles, but it’s a mistake to think that means you don’t have fun. Like you, King Tut is young at heart, and he matches the wisdom of a king with the boyish enthusiasm that comes from never aging past 19. You’ll have the sort of whimsical relationship that will make your hearts feel lighter than a feather.
 
					Playful and principled, you two are so well matched, you’ll be wrapped around each other like cloth on a mummy. The only curse of this Pharaoh is that you won’t be able to get him out of your mind!
				</span>
				<span id="evitaText" style="display:none">
					You’re always daydreaming, you have a bounce in your step, and deep down, you still believe in fairy tales.
 
					Your Princess Charming is none other than Evita Peron! Let this brilliant and beautiful porteña rescue you from ordinary life and sweep you into her tale of rags-to-riches-to-goddess.
 
					From portraying them on the silver screen, to making them real as a politician, Evita is a woman of dreams. And, I’m sure you’ll find, she’s the woman of your dreams. Whether you’re sipping Malbec together or campaigning for women’s suffrage, your time together will be magical.
 
					Evita’s generous reforms for the poor made her beloved among the descamisados. After one date, you’ll want to be shirtless, too.
 
					Give this relationship a try and you’ll see why people worshipped her.
